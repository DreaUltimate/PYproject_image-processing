This project is an example of image processing using Python and the OpenCV library. 
The goal of this project is to detect edges in an image and draw contours around them. 
To achieve this, we first read the image from a webcam, then convert it to grayscale, apply Gaussian blur, and finally use Canny edge detection to detect edges in the blurred image. We then find contours in the edged image and draw them on the original image. Finally, we display the resulting frame with contours drawn on it. 

This project demonstrates how powerful Python and OpenCV can be when used together for image processing tasks.
